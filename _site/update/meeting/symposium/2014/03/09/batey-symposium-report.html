<p>Prepared by Lawrence Loh, MD, MPH, CCFP, FRCPC for The 53rd Week</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2014 saw the first breakthrough result of nearly three years of efforts to develop a collaborative community of providers and local leaders around the provision of healthcare, construction and health promotion efforts to batey communities in La Romana. Representatives of several short-term volunteer teams that work with Good Samaritan Hospital attended a full-day symposium at Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Together with The 53rd Week, the organisations with representatives present included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hospital El Buen Samaritano, La Romana</li>

<li>The Good Samaritan Mission Council</li>

<li>First Baptist Church, Wallingford</li>

<li>Gwynedd Mercy (via remote link)</li>

<li>Massachusetts General Hospital</li>

<li>Medicines for Humanity</li>

<li>McMaster University</li>

<li>Quinnipiac University</li>

<li>University of Massachusetts Medical School</li>

<li>UMass Memorial Medical Center</li>

<li>University of Texas Medical Branch (via remote link)</li>

<li>University of Toronto</li>

<li>Villanova University</li>
</ul>

<p>The need and case for collaboration was made clear throughout the day, with a wide range of presentations that enabled information exchange and discussions of the issues in providing care in the bateyes that might serve as a launching pad for collaboration. It was evident that many of the teams were experiencing many of the same challenges in maximising outcomes and benefits to the communities of La Romana and in working with local partnership.</p>

<p>This report aims provides background on the origins and history of the collaborative process, reviews the presentations and discussions associated during the symposium, and provides editorial for potential next steps to be taken by the groups in attendance.</p>

<h2 id="history_and_context">History and context</h2>

<p>Work in the bateyes of La Romana by visiting North American teams together with Good Samaritan Hospital has been occurring since the 1980s. At present, nearly 30 teams are involved in the provision of mobile medical clinic care and construction care in La Romana. Nearly 13-14 of those specific teams were represented at the meeting on February 10, along with Hospital El Buen Samaritano leadership and other external experts and new partners who are entering the La Romana ecosystem. This represents a critical mass and tremendous opportunity to build on the great work being done by teams individually.</p>

<p>Previous symposia have been held, but there had been no attempts to bring teams together until recently. The first steps revisiting the idea occurred in fall 2011, where the leaders of the group The 53rd Week reached out to Bob Beck of the Good Samaritan Mission Council and the then-medical student leaders of the University of Massachusetts Medical School La Romana Medical Trip in Framingham, Massachusetts. This initial discussion led to the planning and execution of a batey health symposium that took place in October 2012 at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts that was attended by members from The 53rd Week, First Baptist Church Wallingford, and the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital. The timing of this meeting coincided with a farewell celebration for Kristy Engel, a long-serving nurse in La Romana who was moving to a new career opportunity in South America.</p>

<h2 id="conference_sessions">Conference sessions</h2>

<p>Rick North, a professional fundraiser, provided the first session and discussed potential means by which a collaborative model could allow the deployment of various fundraising mechanisms to better support care and development work in La Romana. He highlighted the rise of baby boomers and the opportunity that arises from their significant potential source of individual donor income, and reviewed the Gates Foundation grant process. North also introduced the Salesforce.com platform, a potential tool for tracking data and sharing information between teams, and reiterated the importance of collecting data on joint projects to demonstrate the value of collaboration and to continue to collectively tailor our teams’ work in the bateyes towards scaling up for additional funding.</p>

<p>Lawrence Loh, Director of Operations at The 53rd Week, provided a presentation on the benefits of collaboration. Key messages included the idea that these multiple various teams working in La Romana represent a significant critical investment, and that the time has come to optimize their impact and minimize duplication and waste. He highlighted the importance of having local guidance and leadership ipn priority setting and to also maintain open lines of communication between all visiting teams and the local leadership to ensure that important, relevant priorities are met. From the investment perspective, Lawrence pointed out that pooling resources could allow teams to collectively target more upstream, meaningful changes rather than providing service alone (e.g. training local providers to shore up local capacity.)</p>

<p>The first morning session then rounded up with introductions, with each group providing background on the length of time they’ve been involved in La Romana, the nature of their work, and what goals they had in attending the symposium. Most encouraging was the willingness to work together even with the enormous diversity in experiences, viewpoints, and professions in the room.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the day, we were fortunate to have Dr. Bido and Moises join us from La Romana to present an overview of the strategic plan for Hospital Buen Samaritano. We also had two excellent presentations from external speakers Laura Baetscher, who described her time in La Romana as a Peace Corps volunteer, Amelia Brandt, with Medicines for Humanity, who provided an overview of the programs being conducted by her organizations in bateyes around other communities and the interesting parallels with the need in La Romana, and also Victoria Winslow, who highlighted the work done by her organization in developing a website that helps Haiti-focused volunteers and non-profits connect on common projects and strategies.</p>

<p>We also enjoyed excellent presentations shared by current volunteer team leaders on various projects being conducted in La Romana. Dr. Al Biggs provided an overview of the work being conducted by the Village Presbyterian Church’s Dominican Republic Medical Partnership, highlighting the hypertension project, health promoter project, and construction work done by the numerous, well-resourced groups out of Kansas City. The hypertension series was continued by Dr Tammie Kear, from Villanova University, who described some of her research and work that had discovered concerns around the hypertensive effects of consumption of traditional “bitter orange” fruit in the Dominican, commonly ingested to treat high blood pressure.</p>

<p>Two students from McMaster University in Canada, Chris Russell and Brendan Wong, presented their experiences and thoughts on a study-abroad semester that they spent working with Good Sam, and provided data on sexual knowledge adequacy among adolescents, while Matthew Dacso from the Univeristy of Texas Medical Branch described some of the wider research initiatives being developed by his team to centralize research work in La Romana. Finally, Caitlin Fogarty from the University of Massachusetts highlighted issues with the hospital referral system, particularly when referral arose from visiting medical teams; this led to a spirited discussion and questions about how to improve and ensure that patients requiring referral would receive it as such.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions_and_next_steps">Conclusions and next steps</h2>

<p>The presentations at the symposium provided the groundwork for discussions on the collaboration; all teams present agreed on the need to pool information and resources and discussed the best way to move forward. A web platform, under development for some time, was proposed as one possible contact mechanism, at least to ensure that scheduling and availability for teams visiting would be tracked.</p>

<p>The population hypertension issue quickly became a lightning rod for attention, given the possibility for good data and measurement as well as collaboration from team to team on both hypertension education (around bitter orange, for example) and collaboration in delivery, continuity of care, and chronic disease tracking / management. The decision was soon taken to ensure regular consistent communications, through an email list, the web platform, and quarterly teleconferences, and to focus on a multi-team committee that would study the hypertension issue in earnest and come up with a joint response to work on this as a quick win going forward.</p>

<p>Future considerations include the development of terms of reference or an overarching umbrella organization to support the exchange of information and data among different teams and to act as a larger fundraising entity. Initial collaboration on the hypertension project will demonstrate the value of working together through shared data and metrics, common educational messages and programming, and demonstrable population health impact.</p>

<p>Together with regular communications over time, this joint project hopefully represents a first step towards developing a wider community of autonomous teams that work towards meaningful upstream goals in the bateyes of La Romana and will help fulfil the original purpose of the hospital in improving the health and well-being of batey residents. It will be exciting to see where things stand at the symposium in 2015.</p>
