I have been quickly working on making a slightly more useful homepage for med.hbsgrupos.org.

So far I have set up this page to house all of the documents and notes from the *2nd Annual Batey Medicine Symposium* (still to be posted) in February, and the notes and information we will need to share as the collaboration efforts move forward.

Right now it is not very *colorful*, but it is at least utilitarian. It is mobile-friendly (meaning it works well on phones and tablets), and it is publicly accessible (the source code for this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/crmackay/med.hbsgrupos.org))
