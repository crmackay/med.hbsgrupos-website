## A few updates:

1. Our Hypertension Working Group is taking shape. If you would still like to participate (it's never too late!), just send me an email and let me know. The working group will be keeping the larger group updated on their progress and will be presenting their efforts up to that point at a conference call (hopefully in May, date TBD)
1. If you are interested in spearheading any other initiatives or efforts, please feel free to use this email list (medcollab@hbsgrupos.org) to solicit input, participation, and ideas from others.
1. If you have any updates that you would like to share with the group feel free to also email them out to the group and/or you may post them to the website (http://med.hbsgrupos.org) (you can do this simply by clicking \"+ Your Update\" and filling out the form on the home page)

Thanks, and as always don't hesitate to email me with any questions, comments, or concerns,
