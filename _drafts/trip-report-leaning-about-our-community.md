## Generalized Results

Taking the time to return to the bateyes for a second day offered a number of advantages. Perhaps the most important was the ability to provide some immediate follow-up services. This was particularly important when treating sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). We were able to diagnose women in our clinic with Chlamydia/Ghonnorhea (one is not able to differentiate between these two, and the CDC recommends that both be treated simultaneously). CDC treatment guidelines explain that one must also treat the partner as well. We were able to make sure that the partners came to clinic the following day to get treated.

### Guaymate Community Hospital

The Guaymate Community Hospital is a two-story building right along the main road in Guaymate. 



### Salud Publica

The ____ public hospital is a teaching hospital that has students from the Universidad Central del Este (UCE) in San Pedro de Macoris. We were able to attend *Entrega de Guardia*, which is their equivalent of *morning report*, but was more of a run-down of the previous nights admissions, with questions and discussions involved.

We were then able to tour the public hospital and get a glimpse of the upcoming construction and remodeling that will be taking place in the next few years. 

Some resources that we noted:
  - 4 functioning neonatal incubators
  - 2 working operating rooms
  - 2 working OB/Gyn operating rooms
  - labor, delivery, and post-partam rooms
  - laboratory facilities
